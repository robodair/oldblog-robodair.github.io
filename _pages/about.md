# Me
Hello pleased to meet you! I'm quite flattered you want to know more about me.

I'm Alisdair Robertson, Australian born and bred, raised in Canberra (don't blame me about the politicians, _you_ voted them in). I'm interested in just about everything tech and I like to dabble in a lot of different areas.

I mostly keep myself busy with work at [Seeing Machines](http://www.seeingmachines.com) and study at the [University of Canberra](http://www.canberra.edu.au), where I'm a good way into a B. Eng in Network & Software Engineering.

Among other things I've worked as an Electrics Technician at [Canberra Theatre Centre](http://canberratheatrecentre.com.au/) and in sales at [Duratone HiFi](http://www.duratone.com.au/)

Outside of work I almost always have a hobby project going, and along with some other UC students I started the [UC Student Developer Organisation](http://sudo.org.au) (SUDO).

# Why this blog
Really, the trigger to starting this blog was starting SUDO, the idea is to encourage real projects, and share knowledge. As I'll be running my fair share of the workshops SUDO will be putting on, I figured I'd better get my act together so I'd have somewhere to publish the things I'll be creating.

I hope you find this useful/informative/funny (depending on what posts you read) and you're welcome to tweet <span style="color:#52adc8">[@robodair](http://twitter.com/robodair)</span> or use the <span style="color:#52adc8">[contact page](/contact)</span> to get my attention.

Happy Hacking!
